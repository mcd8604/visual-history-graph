Visual History displays your Chrome history as an interactive graph.

You can install this Chrome Webapp [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emnpecigdjglcgfabfnmlphhgfdifaan).
Please signal any issue in the dedicated tab in this site.

Visual History uses Javascript and HTML5 datastore mechanism (LocalStorage). A SVG graph is produced through the use of the [Protovis](http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/) library.
The history graph can be exported in the GEXF format for use in [Gephi](http://www.gephi.org).
